# Graph-minors-using-phased-check-and-bitmasks
This repository contains a Python implementation (using SageMath) for checking whether one graph is a minor of another. The algorithm represents graphs with adjacency bitmasks and follows a three-phase approach: edge contraction, vertex deletion, and edge deletion.
